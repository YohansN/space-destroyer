## About the game

**Space Destroyer** is a game inspired by the classic arcade game called "**Asteroids**".

In Space Destroyer, you are a crew member aboard a spaceship stuck in an asteroid field.

The main objective of the game is to survive five waves of enemies (asteroids) of different sizes.

You need to manage your life, fuel, and shields in order to survive throughout the level.

The game features an upgrade system where you can select a random upgrade card every time you fill the experience bar. You do that by destroying the asteroids and earning XP points. Different sizes of asteroids give different quantities of points.
